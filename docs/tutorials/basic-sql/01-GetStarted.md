## Requirement
To be able to follow this tutorial you will need software below installed in your machine.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 8 or newer version 
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 
* [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/#installation) 
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) 
  
> Yarn is required, Plumier Starter cli app use Yarn internally to initiate the starter project.

Test the following code in your terminal application (Terminal, Cmd, Powershell, Git Bash) to make sure everything installed properly.

```bash
$ node -v
$ npx -v
$ yarn -v
$ code -v
$ http --version
```

Make sure all commands above returns appropriate installed version.

For mac user make sure you can launch VSCode from terminal using `code .` command like explained [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

## Initiate Basic Starter
Plumier provided some project starters which already have basic setup of Plumier rest api. In this example we will use Plumier Starter cli package to initiate our project. 

Open your terminal application and enter command below to start initiate project

```bash
$ npx plumier-starter
```

Command above will download the Plumier Starter package from npm registry and execute its command immediately after finished download.

* Plumier Starter will ask for project name, enter `todo-sql-backend` and press enter.
* Next Plumier Starter will ask for what starter will you use. Select `basic-rest-api` using arrow key on your keyboard and enter to confirm your selection.

Wait a few seconds until Plumier Starter finish downloading the starter and install dependencies for you.

Enter to the created directory, and launch Visual Studio Code on that directory by using command below

```bash
$ cd todo-sql-backend
$ code .
```

Code above should open Visual Studio Code with some files setup like picture below.

![vscode](../../assets/tutorial/vscode.png)

If Visual Studio Code not opened you can manually open the directory from Visual Studio Code menu. 

## Run The Project
Lets run the project starter to see if its downloaded and installed properly. Open [Visual Studio Code integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and enter command below to start the project

```bash
$ yarn debug
```

Code above will host the starter project on port 8000, it will print route analysis report showing two routes generated like below

```bash
yarn run v1.12.3
warning package.json: No license field
$ ts-node-dev --inspect -- src/index
Using ts-node version 8.0.2, typescript version 3.3.3333
Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/742ac15a-8320-49c4-8b91-390bda03f3bc
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector

Route Analysis Report
1. ExamplesController.list() -> GET /api/v1/examples
2. HomeController.index()    -> GET /

Server running http://localhost:8000/
```

Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ you should see hello world message in JSON format like picture below
