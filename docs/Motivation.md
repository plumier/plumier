My personal feelings about TypeScript framework nowadays is most of them are too advanced, even to start creating a very simple API you start preparing yourself with some theory of Separation of Concern, Dependency Injection, SOLID principle etc. Most of them take advantage of fanciness, where framework provided a mandatory rule on how you layout your code, how you should separate your logic to keep it clean and SOLID. While keep robustness and secureness optional because with the building block provided by the framework you can create your own type conversion, validator or authorization on top of an existing library such as Joi, Passport etc.

Welcome to Plumier where robustness and secureness is mandatory and fanciness is optional. Plumier provided some built-in functionalities that work in the background to make simplest Plumier controller keep secure and robust. 

```typescript
class AnimalsController {

}


```
