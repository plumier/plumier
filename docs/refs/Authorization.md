## Enable Facility
Authorization can be enabled by using `@plumier/jwt` package and plugging `JwtAuthFacility` into Plumier application 

```typescript
import { JwtAuthFacility } from "@plumier/jwt"

const app = new Plumier()
app.set(new JwtAuthFacility({ secret: "<your secret key>" }))
```

## Setup
Plumier authorization uses standard token based authentication using json web token, internally it uses [koa-jwt](https://github.com/koajs/jwt) middleware. 

To be able to authorize user, you need to specify `role` field when signing json web token on the login process. 

```typescript
class AuthController{
    //allow access to public
    @authorize.public()
    @route.post()
    async login(data: Login) {
        //check for username / password
        //if OK then return signed token
        return { 
            accessToken: jwt.sign({ 
                email: "<user email>", 
                //defined the role
                role: "<user role>" 
            }, "<your secret key>"),
        }
    }
}
```

Value of the role can be a string or an array of string that will be used by `@authorize.role(<user role>)`. 

## Custom Field Name
By default `JwtAuthFacility` will look for `role` field in your signed token. If you don't like the `role` field on the signed token you can specify the `roleField` with the name of the field in your token.

Example, your role field in the signed token is `access`

```typescript
jwt.sign({ 
    email: "<user email>", 
    //defined the role
    access: "<user role>" 
}, "<your secret key>"),

```

Specify the field name on the `JwtAuthFacility`

```typescript
const app = new Plumier()
app.set(new JwtAuthFacility({ secret: "<your secret key>", roleField: "access" }))
```

If you require a real time access to the role vs reading from token claim (because the user role changes needs to wait for the token to expired first), you can provide a function to get the user role for real time role access. But keep in mind that this trick will make every request touch the database that will impact performance:

```typescript
const app = new Plumier()
app.set(new JwtAuthFacility({ secret: "<your secret key>", roleField: async user => getUserRole(user._id) }))
```

## All Routes are Secured
By enabling `JwtAuthFacility` all routes are secured, means if end user access your API without token they will receive 403.

> You can provided global public authorization if you like it


## Public Route
To make specific route accessible by public, use `@authorize.public()` to allow access to all user including user without token.

```typescript
export class ProductsController {
    @authorize.public()
    @route.get(":id")
    get(id: string) { }
}
```

| Route                | Access |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| `GET /products/<id>` | public |


## Role Authorization 
Authorize access to specific route using `@authorize.role(<list of role>)`

```typescript
export class ProductsController {
    @authorize.public()
    @route.get(":id")
    get(id: string) { }

    @authorize.role("admin")
    @route.post("")
    save(data: Product) {}
}
```

| Route                | Access |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| `GET /products/<id>` | public |
| `POST /products`     | admin  |


## Controller Decorator
Decorated action one by one will be cumbersome, you can apply `@authorize` decorator on controller to apply authorization on all routes contained.

```typescript
@authorize.role("admin")
export class ProductsController {
    @route.get(":id")
    get(id: string) { }

    @route.post("")
    save(data: Product) { }
}
```

| Route                | Access |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| `GET /products/<id>` | admin  |
| `POST /products`     | admin  |


## Controller Decorator Override
If controller and action decorated with `@authorize` decorator, the action authorization will replace the controller authorization

```typescript
@authorize.role("admin")
export class ProductsController {
    @authorize.role("admin", "user")
    @route.get(":id")
    get(id: string) { }

    @route.post("")
    save(data: Product) { }

    @route.put(":id")
    save(id:string, data: Partial<Product>) { }
}
```

| Route                | Access      |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `GET /products/<id>` | admin, user |
| `POST /products`     | admin       |
| `PUT /products/<id>` | admin       |


## Getting Login User Information

To get login user information from within action, you can use `@bind.user()` parameter binding.

```typescript
export class ProductsController {
    @route.get(":id")
    get(id: string, @bind.user() user:LoginUser) { }
}
```

`LoginUser` class is a class that the properties match with claims when you signed the token.


## Parameter Authorization
Grant access to pass value to parameter to specific role. This feature useful when you want to restrict the API consumer to set some property of your domain without creating a new domain/method.

> Parameter authorization only affect on how the end user send/provided the data. It will not affect how the data will be retrieved. Means **it will not** automatically filter some property based on role on the JSON result.


```typescript
@domain()
export class User {
    constructor(
        name: string,
        //only admin can send deceased
        @authorize.role("admin")
        disabled: boolean | undefined
    ) { }
}

export class UsersController {
    @route.post()
    save(data: User) {   }
    @route.put(":id")
    save(@val.partial(User) data: Partial<User>) {   }
}
```

Using above code, only admin can disabled the user, if user doesn't have admin role Plumier will return 401 with informative error result.

## Global Authorization
As mentioned above, by default all routes is secured when `JwtAuthFacility` applied, you can override this default behavior by applying `authorize` on the `JwtAuthFacility` configuration like below:


```typescript
const app = new Plumier()
app.set(new JwtAuthFacility({ secret: "<your secret key>", global: authorize.public() }))
```
